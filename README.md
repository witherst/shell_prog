# shell_prog
Writing a small shell in C, similar to bash.

The shell will run command line instructions and return results similar to other shells, but without the fancier features.

This shell will allow for redirection of standard input and standard output and it will support both foreground and background
processes.

This shell will support three built-in commands: exit, cd, and status. It will also support comments, which are lines beginning with
the # character.
